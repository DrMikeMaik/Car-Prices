# Car-Prices

This is my solution for [Data Workshop's](http://dataworkshop.eu/) [Car Price Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carprice).

* [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt)
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)


## Data

The data is downloaded form the Kaggle page for Car Price Prediction competition. It should be placed in a folder called **data** in order for the code to work.
